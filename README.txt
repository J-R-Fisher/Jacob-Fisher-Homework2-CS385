Hello Dr. Briggs,

Welcome to my website. It's pretty wild that you're here.

I have no idea how this will look with expression web because I got annoyed
with it and switched to vs code with an html local server extension.
It's basically the exact same functionality except with non-outdated auto-complete.
Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with that but man, JavaScript without intellisense
is the true hard mode.

Anyhow,

My recommendation would be to launch this site using something like node or whatever
the default python web server is called. Obviously you can launch it in the browser
and just see the html too.

Best,
Jacob
